    <p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>
    
  

    <ul>
      <li>Broken elements: This can happen easily when you're typing quickly or the autocomplete feature in your text editor gets ahead of you.</li>
      <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not</strong> closed properly, then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend.</li>

      <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong</strong> <em>strong emphasised?what is this?</em> </li>
    </ul>
